For the OMS SensorThings Session, all relevant information is available from the [API4INSPIRE Site](https://datacoveeu.github.io/API4INSPIRE/) in the [SensorThings API sections](https://datacoveeu.github.io/API4INSPIRE/sensorthingsapi/1_Home.html)

For this presentation we will forego dedicates slides as all information is available from the site.

For users who would like to create their own examples, all that is required is a text editor and a browswer for viewing, details in the [STA section Mapping](https://datacoveeu.github.io/API4INSPIRE/sensorthingsapi/4_Mapping.html)

We look forward to seeing you all there!
